## Dependencies
- Each phase generally depends on the successful completion of previous phases
- Time tracking (6.3.1) depends on task management (6.2)
- Tag management (6.2.1) depends on task management (6.2)
- Cost tracking (5.4-5.6) depends on role system (8.2)
- Financial reporting (7.3) depends on cost tracking implementation (5.4-5.6)
- PWA features (10.3) depend on basic time entry functionality (6.3.1)
- Ag-Grid (9.9) is implemented early as it's used throughout the application
- Authentication (5.1-5.2) depends on multi-tenancy implementation (1.14)
- All subsequent features must respect tenant isolation

## Risk Management
- Docker setup issues: Allow extra time for containerization troubleshooting
- UI consistency: Regular reviews of glassmorphism implementation
- Performance: Monitor Ag-Grid performance with large datasets
- Data integrity: Thorough testing of cost calculations and financial reports
- PWA reliability: Test offline functionality thoroughly
